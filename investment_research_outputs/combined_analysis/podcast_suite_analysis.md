   Summary:

   - **Main Topic Discussed:** The podcast discusses the potential impact of tariffs proposed by Donald Trump on silver, and the ongoing scarcity and price movements in the silver market involving the US and the BRICS nations.



- **Key Insights and Predictions:**

  - The US and BRICS nations are reportedly consuming significant amounts of silver.

  - The current administration, led by Trump, is considering imposing tariffs that could limit silver exports from the US.

  - A surge in the silver lease rate at London indicates increased borrowing of physical silver, suggesting scarcity.

  - Silver's Exchange for Physical (EFP) spreads between London and New York have risen, indicating a lack of trust in London's silver inventory.



- **Investment Recommendations:**

  - Investors may want to consider physical silver investments as scarcity could drive up prices.

  - Monitoring changes in tariffs and geopolitical decisions could provide insights into future silver price movements.



- **Economic/Market Analysis:**

  - Rising silver lease rates in London suggest a tightening supply, with the EFP spread signaling distrust in the available physical inventory.

  - Reports indicate a depletion of the silver inventory in London's LBMA vaults, with significant withdrawals by participants.

  - The price of silver in New York is higher than in London, which complicates the import-export dynamics for British silver.



- **Notable Quotes or Statements:**

  - "The US is going to keep all this strategic metal within its borders."

  - "The lease rate over there has blown up from slightly above zero to 6% within a week and a half."

  - "Silver in New York is now trading at a $1 premium over London."

  - Concerns are raised about whether significant reserves of silver in New York are already accounted for, suggesting potential shortages.

  

Overall, the discussion underscores a potential shift towards tighter control and scarcity of silver, influenced by geopolitical moves such as tariffs and strategic stockpiling by major economies.

2. **Debt Stress:** Indirectly implied by discussions of US military strategy and resource allocation affecting government revenue and expenditures.



3. **Tech Disruption:** Not directly addressed, but the strategic importance of metals like silver for technological and military advancements is noted.
